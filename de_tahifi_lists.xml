        Retrieve range of list items.

        Partial lists can be read out over D-Bus using a triple of list ID,
        first index in that list, and the maximum number of items to return.
        The method returns
        1. the number of items sent; and
        2. the requested items as an array of tuples containing
          1. the item ID;
          2. the displayable item text (UTF-8); and
          3. a flag that indicates whether or not the item is a directory.

        Item ID 0 always denotes the first entry in a list. A maximum number of
        0 indicates that all items in the list should be sent.

        List IDs are opaque non-zero identifiers managed internally by list
        brokers. No application shall make any assumptions about these IDs,
        except maybe that they are probably completely random numbers and that
        ID 0 is invalid. Only IDs retured by \c GetListId can be used safely to
        invoke this method. In case an invalid list ID is used in an
        invokation, the returned error code will be set accordingly.

        The method may take a rather long time to generate an answer in case
        the list contents have to be fetched over a network. If such a blocking
        behavior is not acceptable in some situation, then the \c CheckRange
        method should be called beforehand.

        \note Lists may become outdated over time in which case the
              \c ListInvalidate signal is sent.

        \param arg_list_id
            Identifier of the list whose items should be retrieved.
        \param arg_first_item_id
            Identifier of the first item in the list to be returned.
        \param arg_count
            Maximum number of list items to return.
        \param proxy, cancellable, callback, user_data GDBus clutter.

        \returns
            The D-Bus method returns an error code to the caller, which is either
            - 0 in case no error occurred;
            - 1 in case the ID passed in \p arg_list_id list was invalid;
            - 2 in case of an I/O error (e.g., broken network connection or
                read error on physical medium).

        \returns
            In case no error occurred, the number of items in the list and the
            requested range of list items themselves are returned; otherwise,
            the number of items is returned as 0 and the returned list is
            empty.

        <!--
        Get list ID for directory-typed list item.

        This method is like an "enter list" operation, expect that nothing is
        really entered at this point; that is, no user interface navigation
        takes place here. Instead, the list broker allocates a list identifier
        for the requested item and may prefetch any data required to populate
        the list. This list identifier is returned to the caller. As long as
        the returned list ID is valid, it can be used to read out list
        contents.

        By sending multiple \c GetListId requests, multiple lists may be
        prefetched in parallel to increase the perceived speed of user
        interface navigation.

        \param arg_list_id, arg_item_id
            List item whose child list ID should be returned. The root list's
            ID is obtained by passing 0 for both \p arg_list_id and
            \p arg_item_id. This can be used as a starting point when no other
            lists are known yet. Consecutive requests must use the returned
            child list ID to reference the root list.
        \param proxy, cancellable, callback, user_data GDBus clutter.

        \returns
            The D-Bus method returns either the requested list ID, or 0 in case
            of an error (e.g., the specified list item does not exist or is not
            a directory).

        <!--
        Hint that the referenced list is not interesting anymore.

        The list broker may use this as a hint to stop prefetching data,
        discard any list items, or even to remove the entire list from its
        cache. When it decides to do the latter, a \c ListInvalidate signal is
        sent.

        Indicate that the list with the given list ID cannot be used anymore.

        There are two particular reasons why a list cannot be used anymore,
        indicated in the return value: (1) list content has changed; or (2)
        memory occupied by the list was reclaimed. In case the list content has
        changed, the new list ID is sent along. Item IDs may or may not be
        valid anymore. In case the list was removed, a new list ID of 0 is
        sent.
