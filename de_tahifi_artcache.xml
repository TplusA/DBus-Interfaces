        Store image data for given key; image data shall be downloaded from
        given URI.

        \param arg_stream_key
            Key for the image associated with a single stream. This is usually
            a hash of the path to the stream the image belongs to. It is an
            error to pass an empty key.
        \param arg_priority
            Image priority in case there are multiple images for the same
            stream. For each key, there can be one image per priority. The
            image with the highest priority "wins".
            Priorities:
            -  0 = Invalid value, do not pass to this method.
            - 10 = Generic image based on source (e.g., a USB symbol, DLNA
                   logo, etc.).
            - 20 = Specific service image read from the service, such as the
                   provided UPnP server icon or streaming service logo.
            - 30 = Image for a directory provided by a trusted directory
                   service such as UPnP or Airable. This is frequently one
                   image that is used for a whole album.
            - 40 = Image for a specific stream provided by a trusted directory
                   service. This is frequently used in playlists where the
                   cover art is different for each stream.
            - 50 = Image data read from stream meta data. This is the image
                   stored inside the stream itself.
        \param arg_image_uri
            URI of the image. The image will be downloaded in the background.
            After it has been downloaded (or on failure), a corresponding
            signal will be emitted on the monitoring interface.
