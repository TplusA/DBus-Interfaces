    Asynchronous error, warning, and information messages.

    Errors emitted through this interface are information potentially of
    interest to the user. Its primary purpose is to provide the user with
    information about problems present in the system which they system itself
    cannot solve. Specific examples are network problems, I/O errors, any
    hardware trouble, and other things which will just happen without being
    related to specific user actions.

    This interface is not meant to be used for general error detection. The
    various D-Bus interfaces have their own means of dealing with errors, and
    these shall be used to detect and recover from errors.

    <interface name="de.tahifi.Errors">
        <!--
        Report some error of interest to the user.

        Sending an error means that some significant condition has occurred
        which the user should be made aware of. Error messages are always
        presented to the user.

        \param arg_code
            An identifier for a specific error. When presenting the error to
            the user, this code shall be used together with any data passed in
            \p arg_context and \p arg_data to generate a useful error message.
            Do not rely on \p arg_message to allow for internationalization.

        \param arg_context
            An optional context which details the error code.

        \param arg_message
            A clear text, English message briefly describing the error. This
            message is meant for use in logs, debugging, and possibly as a
            fallback in case the error code is not recognized. Note that \e any
            kind of message is allowed here, and it may be different for
            different error messages of the same error code. In general, it is
            impossible to parse these messages or to translate them
            automatically to other languages.

        \param arg_data
            Any data which could be necessary to make the generated error
            message presented to the user as helpful as possible. The correct
            interpretation of this field depends on the error code.

        \param object
            GDBus clutter.

        <!--
        Report some warning message, potentially of interest to the user.

        Warnings are like errors, but they might get filtered out or be
        presented in much more subtle ways that error messages.

        See \c de.tahifi.Errors.Error for parameters.

        Report some information which might be of interest to the user.

        Use this signal sparingly, if at all. Non-error information are usually
        reported through interfaces specifically designed to transport certain
        kinds of information. Information not intended for the user should
        simply go to the log. No news is good news.

        See \c de.tahifi.Errors.Error for parameters.
