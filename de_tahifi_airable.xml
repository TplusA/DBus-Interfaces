        <!--
        Inform system about changes of the user's service login status.

        This signal enables keeping the user's login status in sync with the
        smartphone app. If the user logs out on the smartphone, then the device
        shall do the same. If the user logs out on the device, then the app
        shall do the same. If the user logs in on the smartphone or on device,
        then the device or smartphone is informed about it.

        Note that the primary goal here is to put the user into the focus of
        action, not the individual devices. If the user logs in or out, then
        all involved devices should follow, not the other way around.

        \param arg_service_id
            String ID of the external service such as \c tidal.

        \param arg_actor_id
            ID of the actor that initiated the change of login status.

        \param arg_log_in
            True if the user has logged in (or tried to), false if the user has
            logged out (or tried to).

        \param arg_error_code
            Error code for the login or logout attempt. This is a regular list
            error code as used in the \c de.tahifi.Lists.Navigation interface.

        \param arg_info
            Additional information about the log in or log out action. In case
            of login, this string will be the user name that was used to log
            into the service. In case of logout, this string will be the URL of
            the logout button to simplify logout action on the other end.

        <!--
        Inform the system that OAuth login is requested by accessing a URL and

        The login will require a browser and some user interaction. Since this
        is something we cannot handle inside the list broker and we don't know
        which UI may handle the request, we emit the request as a signal and
        rely on some process catching it.

        \param arg_service_id
            The service which requests OAuth authentication.

        \param arg_context_hint, arg_list_id, arg_item_id
            Some data for catchers of this signal to tell which access may have
            triggered the authentication request.

        \param arg_login_url
            OAuth login URL as sent by Airable.

        Explicitly abort the data retrieval for given cookies.

        \param arg_cookies
            An array of pairs of cookie and flag. The flag tells the list
            broker whether or not to keep the result in case the operation
            which generated the result has completed successfully. True means
            that the result should be kept around so that retrieval is still
            possible (avoids undesired effects of certain race conditions),
            false means that the result should be dropped in any case (if the
            caller is not interested in the result anymore).
