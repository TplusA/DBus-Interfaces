    <!--
    Client interface for requesting power status and status changes.

    Methods defined by this interface can be invoked by clients that need to
    know about power status changes. These clients may react to imminent power
    loss by closing files and syncing them.

        <!--
        Tell power daemon that we must be part of the power down sequence.

        This method may fail in case a previously active power down sequence
        has already succeeded, i.e., a power down request was issued and all
        previously registered clients have agreed that powering down is OK.

        Consequently, programs should invoke this method _before_ doing
        anything that may mess up the system in the event of power loss, and
        they should not start doing any such things in case this method fails.

        \param arg_client_name
            Unique name of the client.
        \param out_client_id

        \param out_cookie, out_forced, out_reason
            In case a power down sequence is already active upon registration,
            then the cookie will have a positive value. In this case, the
            parameters have the same meaning as those posted with the
            \c de.tahifi.Power.Events.StopRequested signal, and the registered
            client is required to react the same way as it would do had it
            received this signal.

            Cookie for the current power down sequence, if any.
        \param out_status
            Power status. 0 for up and running; 1 for stop in progress; 2 for

        Tell power daemon that powering off is OK for us.

        Each client that has registered with de.tahifi.Power.Client.Hi should
        invoke this method after seeing a de.tahifi.Power.Events.StopRequested
        signal. It must use the cookie sent along with that signal so that race
        conditions during transients are eliminated.

        The power down sequence will only succeed if all registered clients
        answer by invoking this method.

        Invoking this method while not powering down has no effect because the
        cookie will most probably be invalid.

        \param arg_client_id
            ID assigned to the client at registration time.
        \param arg_cookie
            Cookie as obtained from de.tahifi.Power.Events.StopRequested or
            de.tahifi.Power.Client.GetStatus.

        <!--
        Request abortion of power down sequence.

        As an alternative to de.tahifi.Power.Client.Ready, this method may be
        invoked by clients that have registered with de.tahifi.Power.Client.Hi
        to request abortion of the power down sequence and to keep the system
        running.

        Note that invoking this method for forced power down is a programming
        error. In this case, the power daemon will interpret an invokation of
        this method as signal that the client is ready for power off. The only
        way for a client to extend power off time is to avoid any method
        invokation in this situation (until power is ultimately switched off
        anyway).

        \param arg_client_id
            ID assigned to the client at registration time.
        \param arg_cookie
            Cookie as obtained from de.tahifi.Power.Events.StopRequested or

        \param arg_cookie
            A random value identifying the power down sequence. This avoids

            Whether or not this power down is strictly necessary. If set to

            will be cut soon.

        When this signal is emitted, the device may be safely powered off. No
        cookie is sent along because it doesn't matter anymore. This state is
        irrevocable.

        It depends on the system what exactly should happen at this point. A
        listener may toggle a GPIO to switch off the power supply the hard way;
        it may shutdown to suspend mode; it may send some message to other
        devices; or it may even just sit there and do nothing.
