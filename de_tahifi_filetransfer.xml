        \param arg_tick
            Progress in ticks, a number between 0 and \p arg_total_ticks
            (including boundaries).

        \param arg_total_ticks
            Maximum number of ticks as configured by the

        \param arg_error_code
            This error code indicates whether or not the transfer was
            successful. Check file de_tahifi_lists_errors.h or
            de_tahifi_lists_errors.hh for possible values and their
            documentation. In case the error code is not 0, the temporary file

            The name of the file as a full path on the local device, or the
            empty string in case of any error. In case no error occurred, the

            \c de.tahifi.FileTransfer.Download() method.
